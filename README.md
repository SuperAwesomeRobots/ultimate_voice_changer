ultimate_voice_changer for Arduino/AVR
======================================

Ultimate real time voice change for Arduino using MCP3208 ADC and MCP4921 DAC with SPI communications.

Eagle schematics and board layout for an Arduino Uno shield are included.

I cannot guarantee that the schematics or board layout are correct! This is my first real PCB project and I am waiting for the first batch of boards to be delivered so use this information at your own risk!

There is a pure AVR version of the software in the avr directory and an Arduino version in the root directory.
