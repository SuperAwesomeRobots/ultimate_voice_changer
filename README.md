# Ultimate Voice Changer Arduino Library

## What is this?

This is the official Arduino library for the Ultimate Voice Changer Arduino Shield, which is an open source hardware project that uses an MCP3208 ADC and an MCP4921 DAC with SPI communications to provide high quality voice sampling and real-time manipulation.

Eagle schematics and board layout for an Arduino Uno shield are included.

## Kits also available

I also sell kits on Tindie if you don't want to order all of the components separately:

## Example sketches

Currently, there is a single sketch available for a ring modulator effect.
